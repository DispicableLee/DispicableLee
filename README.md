Coming from an arts background at Sarah Lawrence College, I had always had an eye for the construction of the things we enjoy, and this eye for craftsmanship has only further developed as I have developed as a software engineer. From the most fundamental ‚Äúhello world‚Äù to applications with robust backend and frontend architectures, this is where all the magic happens, and I cannot be more pleased to have you here.
